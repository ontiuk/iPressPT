# Notice! Do not place your custom translation files here.

It is recommended that you use the global WordPress language directory and install your translations with the format, e.g. '/wp-content/languages/themes/ipress-it_IT.mo`. 
This ensures that they will not be lost or overwritten during iPress updates.

iPress will look in this directory for translations as a fallback. 

Alternatively you can put translations in your child theme, e.g. '/wp-content/themes/child-theme/languages/it_IT.mo'.
